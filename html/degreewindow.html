          polluters like coal</a> - the average global temperature has risen 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That may not sound like much, but even with 1°C of warming, we’ve seen significant changes in our environment - 
          frequent forest fires, <a href='https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/glossary/#:~:text=Risk%2C%20and%20Vulnerability.-,heatwave,-A%20period%20of' target="_blank">heat waves</a>, 
          and more dangerous storms. These changes will only get worse with each .5°C increase, and new problems will arise. As determined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) report on climate change, 
          1.5°C is the current limit on how much the global temperature can rise while giving humans enough time to <a href='https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/glossary/#:~:text=See%20Adaptive%20capacity.-,adaptation,-In%20human%20systems' target="_blank">adapt</a>

                into the atmosphere. CO2 in higher concentrations is toxic to humans, plants, and animals. CO2 is called a greenhouse gas becaus it absorbs heat, which makes the air and land warmer, much like a greenhouse for plants traps in heat.

              <p class='text'>Forest fires, as you may have seen in the news, increase in frequency and size as the climate gets warmer. Hotter temperatures lead to drier, more-flammable vegetation and earlier, longer summers and fire seasons. Burning trees and other plants releases toxic smoke and ash which is harmful to humans and animals. Fires also disrupt electrical systems - from companies shutting them down before or during a fire to fires destroying them altogether.
